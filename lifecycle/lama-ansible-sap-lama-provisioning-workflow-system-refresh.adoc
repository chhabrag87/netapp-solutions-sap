summary: During the refresh workflow, the storage clone must be deleted. You can use the same Ansible playbook as for the system destroy workflow. However, the custom hook is defined to a different step, so the playbook is named accordingly. The process step for the clone does not differ.

It contains Export configuration, stop system, unprepare system, delete storage clone, storage cloning, prepare system, activate isolation, system rename, start system, import configuration, post copy automation, and deactivate isolation."]

During the refresh workflow, the storage clone must be deleted. You can use the same Ansible playbook as for the system destroy workflow. However, the custom hook is defined to a different step, so the playbook is named accordingly. The process step for the clone doesn´t differ.

The refresh workflow can be triggered through the provisioning screen for a copied system.

Again, nothing differs in the input screens from the standard, and the workflow execution can be started from the summary screen.
