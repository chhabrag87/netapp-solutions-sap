The following sections describe the restore and recovery workflows of three different scenarios and example configurations.

* Automated restore and recovery:
** Auto discovered HANA system SS1
** SAP HANA single host, MDC single tenant system using NFS
* Single-tenant restore and recovery:
** Auto discovered HANA system SM1
** SAP HANA single host, MDC multiple tenant system using NFS
* Restore with manual recovery:
** Manual configured HANA system SS2
** SAP HANA single host, MDC multiple tenant system using NFS

In the following sections, the differences between SAP HANA single host and multiple hosts and Fibre Channel SAN attached HANA systems are highlighted.

The examples show SAP HANA Studio as a tool to execute manual recovery. You can also use SAP HANA Cockpit or HANA SQL statements.

== Automated restore and recovery

With SnapCenter 4.3, automated restore and recovery operations are supported for HANA single container or MDC single tenant systems that have been auto discovered by SnapCenter.

You can execute an automated restore and recovery operation with the following steps:

. Select the backup to be used for the restore operation. The backup can be selected from the following storage options:

** Primary storage
** Offsite backup storage (SnapVault target)

. Select the restore type. Select Complete Restore with Volume Revert or without Volume Revert.
+
[NOTE]
The Volume Revert option is only available for restore operations from primary storage and if the HANA database is using NFS as the storage protocol.

. Select the recovery type from the following options:
+
** To most recent state
** Point in time
** To specific data backup
** No recovery
+
[NOTE]
The selected recovery type is used for the recovery of the system and the tenant database.

Next, SnapCenter performs the following operations:

. It stops the HANA database.
. It restores the database.
+
Depending on the selected restore type and the used storage protocol, different operations are executed.
+
** If NFS and Volume Revert are selected, then SnapCenter unmounts the volume, restores the volume using volume-based SnapRestore on the storage layer, and mounts the volume.
** If NFS is selected and Volume Revert is not selected, SnapCenter restores all files using single-file SnapRestore operations on the storage layer.
** If Fibre Channel SAN is selected, then SnapCenter unmounts the LUN(s), restores the LUN(s) using single file SnapRestore operations on the storage layer, and discovers and mounts the LUN(s).

. It recovers the database:
.. It recovers the system database.
.. It recovers the tenant database.
+
Or, for HANA single container systems, the recovery is executed in a single step:
+
.. It starts the HANA database.

[NOTE]
If No Recovery is selected, SnapCenter exits and the recovery operation for the system and the tenant database must be done manually.

This section provides the steps for the automated restore and recovery operation of the auto discovered HANA system SS1 (SAP HANA single host, MDC single tenant system using NFS).

. Select a backup in SnapCenter to be used for the restore operation.
+
[NOTE]
You can select restore from primary or from offsite backup storage.
+

+
image:saphana-br-scs-image105.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. SnapCenter executes the restore and recovery operation. This example shows the job details of the restore and recovery job.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image106.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

== Single-tenant restore and recovery operation

With SnapCenter 4.3, single-tenant restore operations are supported for HANA MDC systems with a single tenant or with multiple tenants that have been auto- discovered by SnapCenter.

You can perform a single-tenant restore and recovery operation with the following steps:

. Stop the tenant to be restored and recovered.
. Restore the tenant with SnapCenter.
+
*  For a restore from primary storage, SnapCenter executes the following operations:
** *NFS.* Storage Single File SnapRestore operations for all files of the tenant database.
** *SAN.* Clone and connect the LUN to the database host, and copy all files of the tenant database.
* For a restore from secondary storage, SnapCenter executes the following operations:
** *NFS.* Storage SnapVault Restore operations for all files of the tenant database
** *SAN.* Clone and connect the LUN to the database host, and copy all files of the tenant database

. Recover the tenant with HANA Studio, Cockpit, or SQL statement.

This section provides the steps for the restore and recovery operation from the primary storage of the auto-discovered HANA system SM1 (SAP HANA single-host, MDC multiple-tenant system using NFS). From the user input perspective, the workflows are identical for a restore from secondary or a restore in a Fibre Channel SAN setup.

. Stop the tenant database.

=== Restore with manual recovery

To restore and recover an SAP HANA MDC single-tenant system using SAP HANA Studio and SnapCenter, complete the following steps:

. Prepare the restore and recovery process with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Select Recover System Database and confirm shutdown of the SAP HANA system.
.. Select the recovery type and the log backup location.
.. The list of data backups is shown. Select Backup to see the external backup ID.
. Perform the restore process with SnapCenter:
.. In the topology view of the resource, select Local Copies to restore from primary storage or Vault Copies if you want to restore from an off-site backup storage.
.. Select the SnapCenter backup that matches the external backup ID or comment field from SAP HANA Studio.
.. Start the restore process.
+
[NOTE]
If a volume-based restore from primary storage is chosen, the data volumes must be unmounted from all SAP HANA database hosts before the restore and mounted again after the restore process is finished.
+
[NOTE]
In an SAP HANA multiple-host setup with FC, the unmount and mount operations are executed by the SAP HANA name server as part of the shutdown and startup process of the database.

. Run the recovery process for the system database with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Click Refresh from the backup list and select the available backup for recovery (indicated with a green icon).
.. Start the recovery process. After the recovery process is finished, the system database is started.
. Run the recovery process for the tenant database with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Select Recover Tenant Database and select the tenant to be recovered.
.. Select the recovery type and the log backup location.
+
A list of data backups displays. Because the data volume has already been restored, the tenant backup is indicated as available (in green).

.. Select this backup and start the recovery process. After the recovery process is finished, the tenant database is started automatically.

The following section describes the steps of the restore and recovery operations of the manually configured HANA system SS2 (SAP HANA single host, MDC multiple tenant system using NFS).

. In SAP HANA Studio, select the Recover System Database option to start the recovery of the system database.
+

+
image:saphana-br-scs-image129.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Unmount all data volumes.
+
....
umount /hana/data/SS2/mnt00001
....
+
[NOTE]
For an SAP HANA multiple host system with NFS, all data volumes on each host must be unmounted.
+
[NOTE]
In an SAP HANA multiple-host setup with FC, the unmount operation is executed by the SAP HANA name server as a part of the shutdown process.

. From the SnapCenter GUI, select the resource topology view and select the backup that should be restored; in our example, the most recent primary backup. Click the Restore icon to start the restore.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image130.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
